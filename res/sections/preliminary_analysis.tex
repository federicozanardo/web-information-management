\section{Preliminary analysis}

\subsection{Context}

\href{https://youngplatform.com}{YoungPlatform} is an Italian cryptocurrency 
exchange. One of the main objectives of this company is to bring those who 
have never heard of cryptocurrencies or who have never used them, closer to 
the world of cryptocurrencies. Therefore they realized that, instead of 
directly developing the exchange, it was more useful to educate users and 
introduce them to this world. So, they decided to develop a learning 
platform, which they called \textit{Academy}. Therefore, the website must 
be usable above all by users who have no experience in the sector and who 
are interested in learning.

\subsection{Website name}

The choice of the website name is crucial to making it easy for users to 
remember. Furthermore, the choice of the name affects on average between 
10\% and 20\% in the usability and quality of the website. In this case, 
the website name consists of two terms: \textit{young} and 
\textit{platform}. The term \textit{young} has been inserted to highlight 
the very young age of the company's founders. Instead \textit{platform} 
has been inserted to indicate that the company's goal is to create a 
series of products, an \textit{ecosystem}, with a different target of 
users: products for newbies, products for users with a medium size of 
the topic and products for expert users. The advantage of using this 
name is that it does not use invented words, but is the composition of 
two known English words. To conclude, the name does not allow a 
neophyte to immediately guess the purpose of the website and what are 
the contents/products it offers, however, for a user who has knowledge 
of the topics, this name represents a reference point for cryptocurrencies 
in the Italian context.

\subsection{Search Engine Optimization}

Using the \textit{LightHouse} tool, the website got a high score (92). In 
particular, you may notice the use of the \verb|<meta name="viewport">| 
tag, as it optimizes the site for mobile device screens of various sizes. 
Additionally, meta descriptions have been added. These descriptions can be 
included in search results, which are useful for summarizing the content of 
the page.

\subsection{Search Engine Results Page positioning}

If you enter short and simple search terms in Italian, as the target of 
the company for the moment is the Italian public, you can see that the 
site appears in the first 10 results. The company has developed a product 
that allows you to earn cryptocurrencies simply by walking. Therefore, by 
entering search terms strictly related to the functionality of this 
product, it is assumed that the site appears among the top 10 results. 
However this did not happen, as the site was found at a position greater 
than 20. Here are some results:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \verb|crytpo exchange|: 8
  \item \verb|crypto exchange italiano|: 1
  \item \verb|comprare bitcoin|: 5
  \item \verb|comprare ethereum|: 7
  \item \verb|comprare crypto|: 4
  \item \verb|comprare criptovalute|: 7
  \item \verb|vendere crypto|: 6
  \item \verb|vendere criptovalute|: 6
  \item \verb|cos'è bitcoin|: beyond the first 20 results
  \item \verb|cos'è la blockchain|: beyond the first 20 results
  \item \verb|guadagnare crypto|: beyond the first 20 results
  \item \verb|guadagnare criptovalute|: beyond the first 20 results
  \item \verb|guadagnare criptovalute gratis|: beyond the first 20 results
  \item \verb|guadagnare criptovalute giocando|: beyond the first 20 results
  \item \verb|guadagnare criptovalute camminando|: beyond the first 20 
  results. As a third result there is an article that talks about the 
  product that allows you to earn cryptocurrencies by walking, in position 
  5 and 6 there are as results the references to the AppStore and the 
  Google Play Store of the app of that product.
\end{itemize}

You may notice that there are several very important keywords that are not 
being exploited to get the website to the top positions of the search 
engine results page. Such a site is more likely to be found through 
articles posted by other websites.
