\subsection{Definition of usability}
The \textit{usability} is a quality attribute that evaluates how easy it is 
for a user to use a product to achieve their goals. This measure is 
different from \textit{accessibility}, as it indicates the ability of a 
site to provide a user experience even for users with disabilities. Thanks 
to the ISO 9241-11:1998 standard it is possible to provide a more precise 
definition, in particular, usability is a measure of:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Effectiveness}: indicates the accuracy and completeness 
  with which users reach their goal;

  \item \textbf{Efficiency}: indicates the resources spent in relation to 
  the accuracy and completeness to which users achieve their goal;

  \item \textbf{Satisfaction}: indicates the degree of comfort with which 
  users have managed to reach their goals through the use of the system.
\end{itemize}

In particular, in the context of websites, accessibility is a quality 
measure that specifies how easily a user interface is usable, and it is 
possible to identify three other components:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Learnability}: indicates how easy it is for a user who 
  uses a website for the first time to get to perform simple actions 
  (i.e., page navigation);

  \item \textbf{Memorability}: indicates how easy it is for a user, who has 
  not visited the website for a long time, to understand how to use it;

  \item \textbf{Mistakes}: indicates how many and how serious are the 
  errors that the user makes while browsing the website. It also indicates 
  how long it takes the user to resolve them.
\end{itemize}

All these components allow us to understand that usability is a decisive 
factor for the success of a website. The greater use of websites nowadays 
implies that the interface must be clear and intuitive to allow even users 
with low technological knowledge to achieve their goals. Therefore, if the 
site is unable to explicitly and clearly illustrate its intent, the user 
will leave the site and look for another service.
